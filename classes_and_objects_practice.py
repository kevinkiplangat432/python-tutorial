# Classes and Objects

# Task 1:
# Create a class `Book` with attributes: title, author, and year.

# Task 2:
# Create a method to display book info.

# Task 3:
# Instantiate two Book objects and print their info.

# Task 4:
# Add a method that returns a dictionary representation of a book (you'll use this idea in Flask JSON APIs).

# Flask Prep Connection:
# Flask models and response objects often use classes to represent and serialize data.

# Modules

# Task 1:
# Create a simple module `helpers.py` with a function `greet(name)` that prints a message.
# Import and use it here.

# Task 2:
# Use a built-in Python module (like `os` or `math`) to perform a small task.

# Task 3:
# Demonstrate relative imports (simulate Flask project structure).

# Flask Prep Connection:
# Flask apps are modular â€” they rely heavily on imports and structured files.

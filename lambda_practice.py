# Lambda Functions

# Task 1:
# Create a lambda function that multiplies two numbers.

# Task 2:
# Use a lambda with the built-in map() to square all numbers in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

# Task 3:
# Use a lambda with filter() to return only even numbers from a list.

# Task 4:
# Sort a list of tuples [(2,5), (1,2), (4,4), (2,3)] by the second element using a lambda.

# Flask Prep Connection:
# Lambdas are often used in Flask for inline data transformations or quick filters inside routes.

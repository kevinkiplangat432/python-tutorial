# Create variables of each core type (int, float, complex, str, list, tuple, dict, set, bool).

# Check the data type of each using type().

# Create a complex number and print its real and imaginary parts.

# Convert a list to a tuple and verify the type.

# Create a mixed list and check the type of each element with a loop.

# Write code that checks if two different data types can be compared using ==.

# Explain what happens when you multiply a string by an integer in Python.

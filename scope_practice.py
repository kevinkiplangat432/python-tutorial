# Variable Scope

# Task 1:
# Create a global variable and a function that modifies it using the `global` keyword.

# Task 2:
# Create a nested function and demonstrate use of `nonlocal`.

# Task 3:
# Show the difference between local and global variables with print statements.

# Flask Prep Connection:
# Understanding scope helps when managing global app configs and avoiding variable conflicts.

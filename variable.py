# Explain what happens when you assign a mutable vs immutable value to a variable.


#immutable
#int
#str
#tuple
#on reassigning it creates new object
Num = 10
Age = Num
Age = 20
print(Num)# output = 10
print(Age)# output =20

#dispite assigning a new value to Age which was equal to Num it did not change the value of Num that's immutability




#mutability
Li =[1,2,3,4,5,6]
NewLi= Li
NewLi.append([7,8,9])

print(NewLi) # outputs 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
print(Li) # outputs 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9

#how to copy a Mutable object.
NewLi = Li.copy()
NewLi.append([7,8,9])

print(NewLi) # outputs 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
print(Li) # outputs 1,2,3,4,5,6
